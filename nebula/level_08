SOLUTION:

Open capture.pcap in Wireshark and press "Follow TCP Stream.
You get "backdoorâ€¦00Rm8.ate." of "backdorr\x7f\x7f\x7f00Rm8\x7fate\x0d"
If we replace the unknown simbols following this rule: \x7f=backspace, \x0d=Carriage-return

We get our password:  backd00Rmate

level08@nebula:~$ ssh flag08@localhost
flag08@nebula:~$ getflag
